## Welcome

Gertrude is platform for creating lightweight and **sustainable digital editions** with accompanying documentation and course materials. Gertrude was designed within the small liberal arts college context in which project teams are small, but may include technologists, librarians, scholars, and students. The platform combines [TEI-XML](https://tei-c.org/) encoded documents, the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and the JavaScript library [CETEIcean](https://www.github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean) to publish standards-compliant editions via a minimal computing method. Critically, the project includes detailed documentation for setting up and customizing the platform, as well as an undergraduate-level syllabus for a course on digital editions. 

Gertrude is named after Gertrude Jekyll, a garden designer of the Arts and Crafts movement. Like gardening, the process of creating a digital edition is slow, iterative, and privileges maintenance over innovation. 

## Impetus

Gertrude began in 2019 as a way to share the results of multiple digital edition projects ([Huon d'Auvergne](https://www.huondauvergne.org/) and [Digital Editions at W&L](https://wludh.github.io/digital-editions/)) created by the [Digital Humanities initiative](https://digitalhumanities.wlu.edu) at Washington and Lee University. Recognizing the need for additional options for publishing digital editions, Digital Humanities Librarian Mackenzie Brooks started documenting and creating a generic form of the platform. 

In 2022, Quinn Dombrowski published the article, "[Minimizing Computing Maximizes Labor](https://dhq.digitalhumanities.org/vol/16/2/000594/000594.html)," in a special issue of *Digital Humanities Quarterly* on minimal computing which does an excellent job of laying out the challenges of implementing minimal computing projects - namely, the question of who is performing the technical labor. Their paper proposes additional "infrastructural interventions" - of which Gertude attempts to be just one.

> "When going “minimal” requires a great deal of technical labor, what implications does that have for its adoption by scholars without ongoing technical support or the money or connections to delegate that work? What is the added emotional labor for technical collaborators who are only allowed to “consult” with scholars, when they attempt to coach scholars through implementing a minimal computing site on their own? What opportunities are lost when a web development methodology cannot reasonably be taught in a hands-on way in a short workshop? After describing these challenges, this paper proposes that an infrastructural intervention — encompassing everything from writing better documentation, tutorials, and templates, to developing interfaces that mediate between users and technical complexity — is necessary to realize the potential of minimal computing as a framework for sustainable websites."

## Ethos

Gertrude is intentionally designed to fill a gap in the digital edition and documentation landscape. It is not an innovative new tool, but rather the combination of existing software to create a productive development environment for small teams with a small amount of technical ability. It keeps pedagogy at its heart.

The Gertrude documentation is aimed at the advanced undergraduate - perhaps a student who is embarking on a summer research experience. It imagines a technologist who can troubleshoot, but not write software from scratch. It imagines a faculty member who is curious and excited but not fluent in Digital Humanities methods. The documentation attempts to fill in the blanks between existing tutorials and solve common issues. It also addresses social and institutional realities when undertaking digital projects. 

Gertrude is indebted to the countless individuals and teams who have participated in the [Institute for Liberal Arts Digital Scholarship](https://iliads.org/).

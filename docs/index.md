# Gertrude Docs

## Welcome
Gertrude is a Jekyll theme, documentation, and course materials for creating a TEI-based digital edition using the static site generator Jekyll and the JavaScript library CETEIcean. It was designed to serve anyone looking to create a digital edition without the resources of a development team or the time to troubleshoot every error message. 

Gertrude is named after Gertrude Jekyll, a garden designer of the Arts and Crafts movement. Gertrude believed THINGS. Like gardening, the process of creating a digital edition is slow, iterative, and privileges maintenance over innovation. 

More information on motivations, credits, etc, can be found on the [About](about/index.html) page.
